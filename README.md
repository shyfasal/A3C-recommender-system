# Overview
Recommender Systems (RecSys) play an important role in helping users discover relevant products, services, or information among countless options.  
Two main approaches are commonly used: **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering**.  

However, challenges remain in the **warm-start** scenario, where user interaction data exists but the system still struggles to deliver truly personalized recommendations.  

This project explores the use of **A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)** to address warm-start issues.  
By leveraging the *advantage function* and asynchronous updates, A3C aims to:  

- âš¡ Reduce gradient variance  
- ðŸ“ˆ Accelerate learning in large action spaces  
- ðŸŽ¯ Improve recommendation accuracy and diversity

**Problem 1 â€“ The Warm Start Challenge**
Even when recommender systems already have historical interaction data from users or items (unlike the cold start problem with no data at all), this information is often not sufficient to generate truly accurate and personalized recommendations. As a result, users still receive suggestions that do not fully reflect their preferences.

**Problem 2 â€“ Limitations of Collaborative Filtering**
Most recommender systems rely on collaborative filtering methods such as Matrix Factorization. While effective in leveraging historical data, these approaches tend to be static and often produce repetitive recommendations. They struggle to capture evolving user preferences over time, which can lead to bias and less adaptive recommendations.

**Problem 3 â€“ Instability of Reinforcement Learning Approaches**
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been introduced to overcome the limitations of static models by continuously updating recommendations based on user interactions. However, conventional RL algorithms still face significant challenges: the high variance of gradientsâ€”especially in large action spacesâ€”leads to unstable learning and suboptimal recommendations.

**Proposed Solution â€“ A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)**
To address these challenges, this research proposes the use of the A3C algorithm, which reduces gradient variance through the advantage function and leverages asynchronous parallel updates. This enables the recommender system to adapt more quickly to changing user preferences, stabilize learning, and deliver more accurate and diverse recommendations.
