# Overview
Recommender Systems (RecSys) play an important role in helping users discover relevant products, services, or information among countless options.  
Two main approaches are commonly used: **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering**.  

However, challenges remain in the **warm-start** scenario, where user interaction data exists but the system still struggles to deliver truly personalized recommendations.  

This project explores the use of **A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)** to address warm-start issues.  
By leveraging the *advantage function* and asynchronous updates, A3C aims to:  

- âš¡ Reduce gradient variance  
- ðŸ“ˆ Accelerate learning in large action spaces  
- ðŸŽ¯ Improve recommendation accuracy and diversity

# Problem RecSys - The Warm-Start Problem
Warm-start occurs when user or item interaction data is already available, but the system still struggles to generate accurate and personalized recommendations. Although methods like collaborative filtering are used, the system tends to be static and fails to adapt to dynamic changes in user preferences.
