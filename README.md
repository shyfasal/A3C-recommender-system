# Overview
Recommender Systems (RecSys) play an important role in helping users discover relevant products, services, or information among the vast number of available options. Two main approaches are commonly used: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. However, significant challenges remain, particularly in the warm-start scenario, where user interaction data already exists but the system still struggles to deliver truly personalized recommendations. 
This project research proposes the use of A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) to address this issue. By leveraging the advantage function and asynchronous updates, A3C can: 
-Reduce gradient
-variance Accelerate learning in large action spaces 
-Improve recommendation accuracy and diversity
