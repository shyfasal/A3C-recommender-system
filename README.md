# Overview
Recommender Systems (RecSys) play an important role in helping users discover relevant products, services, or information among the vast number of available options. Two main approaches are commonly used: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. However, significant challenges remain, particularly in the warm-start scenario, where user interaction data already exists but the system still struggles to deliver truly personalized recommendations. 
This project explores the use of **A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)** to address warm-start issues.  
By leveraging the *advantage function* and asynchronous updates, A3C aims to:  

- âš¡ Reduce gradient variance  
- ðŸ“ˆ Accelerate learning in large action spaces  
- ðŸŽ¯ Improve recommendation accuracy and diversity
